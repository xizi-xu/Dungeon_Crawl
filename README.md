Dungeon_Crawl
=============

A simple program that outputs a simple grid based gameboard to the screen using characters.
The user (marked by G) can move up, down, left, or right using w, s, a, and d keys.

If the user steps on a trap (marked by T), then he loses.
Mark X is the destination.
Enemies (marked by E) move randomly in any direction once per turn and the user loses if he touches them.
